## About PatriarX

The PRIN project “PatriarX: Paths of the Transmission of Saint Cyril’s Lexicon” aims at fostering an exhaustive investigation of the manuscript tradition of St. Cyril’s Lexicon, a sort of “dictionary” in ancient Greek. This dictionary can be dated to around the 5th century AD, and is the first to simultaneously convey quotations from Christian, Jewish and secular authors, from Homer onwards. It was very popular already in Late Antiquity, and was therefore copied hundreds of times on Medieval manuscripts. On account of the extent and complexity of its tradition, this work has only been partially studied in modern times, and there is no complete critical edition of it.
